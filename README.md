# ASP.NET Core IdentityServer4 and Identity
Authorization management using ASP.NET Core Identity and IdentityServer4. This codebase will give an idea how Identity and IdentityServer works side by side using EfCore Sqlite. For simplicity, I have used Sqlite. But also added support for SqlServer.

### Features: 
- EfCore with Sqlite
- Easily configurable to use SqlServer
- ASP.NET Core Identity
- IdentityServer4
- Configure IdentityServer4 and Identity with EfCore Sqlite

### How to run the project: 
Just clone the repo and press F5. It will automatically create AuthorizationManagement.db Sqlite database and populate with some dummy data related to Identity and IdentityServer.
