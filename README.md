# ASP.NET Core IdentityServer4 and Identity
Authorization management using ASP.NET Core Identity and IdentityServer4. This codebase will give an idea how Identity and IdentityServer works side by side using EfCore Sqlite. I have used Sqlite for simplicity. It's easily configurable to use SqlServer.

### Features: 
- EfCore with Sqlite
- ASP.NET Core Identity
- IdentityServer4
- Configure IdentityServer4 and Identity with EfCore Sqlite

### How to run the project: 
Just clone the repo and press F5. It will automatically create AuthorizationManagement.db Sqlite database and populate with some dummy data related to Identity and IdentityServer.
